## Crop Production Analysis in India

### Project Overview
The Crop Production Analysis project aims to analyze historical crop production data in India to identify trends, patterns, and factors influencing crop yields. This project involves data extraction, transformation, cleaning, detailed analysis, and building a predictive model to forecast future crop production using machine learning techniques.

### Objectives
- Analyze crop production trends across different states and districts in India.
- Understand the impact of different seasons on crop production.
- Identify key crops contributing to overall production.
- Develop a predictive model to forecast future crop production based on historical data.

### Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Languages**: Python, SQL
- **Software/Platforms**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Libraries**:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn

### Data Collection
**Data Sources**: The primary dataset used in this analysis is `crop_production.csv`. This dataset contains detailed information on crop production across various states and districts in India, including columns such as State_Name, District_Name, Crop_Year, Season, Crop, Area, and Production.

### Data Description
The dataset comprises:
- `State_Name`: The name of the state.
- `District_Name`: The name of the district.
- `Crop_Year`: The year of crop production.
- `Season`: The season in which the crop was grown (e.g., Kharif, Rabi).
- `Crop`: The type of crop.
- `Area`: The area under cultivation (in hectares).
- `Production`: The crop production (in tonnes).

### Data Preprocessing
Data cleaning steps include:
- Dropping rows with missing values in the `Production` column.
- Removing duplicate entries.
- Ensuring correct data types for columns like `Crop_Year`, `Area`, and `Production`.

### Data Transformation
Performed aggregation and grouping for various analyses:
- State-wise Area and Production
- District-wise Area and Production
- Season-wise Production
- Crop-wise Production

### Data Analysis & Visualization
Various visualizations were created to explore the data:
- **State-wise Area and Production**: Bar plots showing total area and production by state.
- **Season-wise Production**: Bar plot showing total production by season.
- **Year-wise Production Trend**: Line plot showing production trend over the years.
- **Crop-wise Production**: Bar plot showing total production by crop.
- **State-wise Production Density Plot**: KDE plot showing production density by state.
- **Crop Production Correlation Heatmap**: Heatmap showing correlations between key numeric variables.
- **Top 10 Districts by Production**: Bar plot showing top districts by production.
- **Pairplot for Key Variables**: Pairplot visualizing relationships between key variables.
- **Production by Crop Type over Years**: Line plot showing production trends for different crops over years.
- **Area vs. Production Scatter Plot**: Scatter plot visualizing the relationship between area and production.
- **Production Distribution by Season**: Box plot showing production distribution by season.

### Predictive Analysis
Implement a predictive model to forecast crop production using a simple linear regression model.

**Preparing the Data**
```python
# Feature selection
X = df[['Area', 'Crop_Year']]
y = df['Production']

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

**Training the Model**
```python
# Train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

**Evaluating the Model**
```python
# Predict on test data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
print(f"R^2 Score: {r2}")
```

### Project Goals
- Provide insights into crop production trends and patterns.
- Assist policymakers and farmers in making informed decisions.
- Predict future crop yields to optimize resource allocation and planning.

### Installation Guide
