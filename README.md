# Crop-Production-Analysis-in-India
### Brief Explanation

The Crop Production Analysis in India project aims to analyze historical crop production data to identify trends, patterns, and factors influencing crop yields across various states and districts in India. This project involves data extraction, transformation, and cleaning to ensure accuracy, followed by detailed analyses to derive insights. Additionally, a predictive model is built to forecast future crop production using machine learning techniques.
